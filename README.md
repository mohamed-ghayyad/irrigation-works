# Irrigation works
C/C++ Application to solve irrigation rotation whatever two-turn rotation or three-turn rotation, longitudinal section design, hydraulic calculations, and design of hydraulic structures like weirs and tail escape.

Currently solving Irrigation rotation for two turn rotation (A , B ) and three-turn rotation ( A, B, C)

Next:

longitudinal section design.

hydraulic calculations.

design of hydraulic structure weirs.

design of tail escape.
